Networking  
Day 2  


#### What We’ll Learn  

The real-world model of modern computer networking:  
The physical layer (the actual infrastructure that exists).  
The internet layer (protocols to give each machine / site an address).  
The transportation layer (protocols to reliably send data over the web).  
The application layer (protocols to enable useful functionality).  


#### Physical Layer – The actual infrastructure that exists  

Computers, Cables, WiFi, Routers  
Internet Layer – Protocols to give each machine / site an address  
IP, DNS  
Transport Layer - Protocols to reliably transfer data over the web  
Packets, TCP, UDP  
Application Layer - Protocols to enable useful functionality  
HTTP / HTTPS, APIs, Websockets

#### Physical Layer – The Actual Infrastructure  

At the deepest level, all data is represented in binary - 0s and 1s (bits).  
Different mediums encode these bits differently for transportation:  
Ethernet – electrical voltage changes on copper wires.  
Fiber Optic – light pulses (on/off)  
Wi-Fi – variations in radio waves.  
Cellular – high-frequency radio signals  
Bluetooth – low-power radio waves.  
Regardless of medium, the sender converts bits to physical signals, and the  
receiver converts these signals back to bits (stored in hard drives, SSDs etc).  


#### Internet Layer – Protocols to Give Addresses  

Every device on the internet needs an IP (Internet Protocol Address)  
to be reachable.  
IP addresses are like postal codes: a location to send data out and  
get responses back.  
When your device sends a request to a website, it includes in the  
request your IP address, so the site knows where to send its  
response back to.
